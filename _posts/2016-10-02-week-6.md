1. What did you do this past week?

    This past week, we continued our discussion on iterators and went on to implement the RangeIterator class. We also learned about the different kinds of contructors, initializer lists and friends.

    From what we discussed in class, friends can be a function, method or class that has access to everything in the class that declared it a friend. The purpose we used a friend function was for the operator == to be symmetric. It would be interesting to see other applications of friends and I wonder if other languages have this kind of concept.

2. What's in your way?

    Currently, in my way is studying for the exam. It's a good thing that I finished other homework that's due at the end of the week so that I can focus completely on studying.

3. What will you do next week?

    This week, I plan on studying for the exam. I want to go over each of the topics and memorize the functions that we implemented in class. I also still need to read the readings and prepare for the daily quizzes.

**Tip of the week:** [Driverless cars](https://medium.com/@lux_capital/why-we-should-adopt-driverless-cars-that-kill-people-9284f325ced0#.j58xnswzl) are in the news more frequently, especially with the recent deaths of people using Tesla's AutoPilot feature. The writer of the article addresses the moral dilemma of driverless cars that can kill people, like in Tesla's case, and argues that they should be adopted.
